# Portfolio Website

## Project Purpose 
The purpose of this project is to create a professional showcase of my front-end development skills and highlight my expertise in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It serves as a platform to demonstrate my passion for web development and provide potential clients and collaborators with a comprehensive overview of my capabilities and previous work. The portfolio website aims to deliver an engaging and user-friendly experience, presenting my projects and achievements in an organized and visually appealing manner.

## How to Develop/Start Locally
To develop/start the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/FigueiredoFelipe/portfolio.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd portfolio

3. Install the dependencies:
npm install

4. Start the development server:
npx vite --port 4000

5. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:4000` to view the website.
Make sure to use the correct port number (4000) based on your configuration or preferences.

## Deployment Environment
The portfolio website was created using Vite, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It can be deployed to any hosting environment that supports static websites. Some popular options include Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, or any web server capable of serving static files.

To deploy the website, you can use the following command:

npm run deploy

Please make sure you have configured the `npm run deploy` script in your `package.json` file or any other relevant deployment configuration file.

This command will trigger your custom deployment script, which may include steps such as building the project using `npm run build`, copying the generated files to the appropriate location, and pushing them to your hosting provider or server.

Make sure to modify the deployment script as needed to match your specific deployment requirements and hosting provider instructions.

## CI/CD
For this project, I currently do not have CI/CD implemented. However, I plan to explore and implement Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment practices in the future to automate the build, testing, and deployment processes.

Some common CI/CD tools and services that I may consider using include Jenkins, Travis CI, CircleCI, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI/CD. These tools can help streamline the development workflow, enable automated testing, and facilitate smooth and efficient deployment of the portfolio website.

If you wish to set up CI/CD for this project, you can explore these tools/services and configure them according to your specific requirements and preferences.
